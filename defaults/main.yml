# will be "root" in both cases. Permissions for this directory will be "0755".
#
# NOTE: The default directory "/usr/local/bin" normally already exists on every

# The directory from where to copy the K8s certificates. By default this
# will expand to user's LOCAL $HOME (the user that run's "ansible-playbook ..."
# plus "/k8s/certs". That means if the user's $HOME directory is e.g.
# "/home/da_user" then "k8s_ca_conf_directory" will have a value of
# "/home/da_user/k8s/certs".

# The IP address or hostname of the Kubernetes API endpoint. This variable
# is used by "kube-proxy" and "kubelet" to connect to the "kube-apiserver"
# (Kubernetes API server).
#
# By default the first host in the Ansible group "k8s_controller" is
# specified here. NOTE: This setting is not fault tolerant! That means
# if the first host in the Ansible group "k8s_controller" is down
# the worker node and its workload continue working but the worker
# node doesn't receive any updates from Kubernetes API server.
#
# If you have a loadbalancer that distributes traffic between all
# Kubernetes API servers it should be specified here (either its IP
# address or the DNS name). But you need to make sure that the IP
# address or the DNS name you want to use here is included in the
# Kubernetes API server TLS certificate (see "k8s_apiserver_cert_hosts"
# variable of https://github.com/githubixx/ansible-role-kubernetes-ca
# role). If it's not specified you'll get certificate errors in the
# logs of the services mentioned above.
